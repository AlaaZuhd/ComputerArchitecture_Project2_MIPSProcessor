# ComputerArchitecture_Project2_MIPSProcessor
In this project a pipelined 16-bit processor was designed and tested with the help of the
Logisim simulator.
A RISC processor with eight 16-bit general purpose registers and a 16-bit program counter
register was implemented, supporting 16 bits instructions with three different formats (R-type, I-type, and J-type) and different addressing modes.
A five-stage pipeline-datapath and its control logic were implemented completely from
scratch. Detection of data dependencies among different instruction was implemented, data
forwarding was achieved successfully and the minimum number of stall cycles was provided.
Following, all details implemented and encountered in the process of implementing this
datapath along with its logic will be illustrated in details and supported by various test cases.
